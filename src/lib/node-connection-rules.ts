/**
 * Canvas connection contract (canvas-baseline §6, owner-ratified 2026-06-21;
 * shot-reference edges added 2026-06-25).
 *
 * Each node exposes a single input handle (no per-slot typing), so a connection
 * is validated at the (sourceType → targetType) level, with image roles
 * resolved on both ends. The matrix is STRICT — it lists only edges that are
 * actually consumed today, so "if you can connect it, it's used" (no
 * silently-ignored dead edges):
 *
 *   - seedance (video) is the aggregator: it reads shot text, image references
 *     (character / background / keyframe / shot), voice audio, and reference
 *     video clips (seedance / videoReference / videoMerge).
 *   - characterImage accepts voice — the voice→character→seedance audio-binding
 *     hop (harvestUpstreamAudioBindings labels @AudioN with the character name).
 *   - shot accepts character + background image references: the shot generator
 *     harvests them as named reference images (harvestUpstreamImageReferences)
 *     and labels them in the prompt legend so the model binds name → image.
 *   - videoMerge aggregates video-source clips.
 *   - every other node type is a leaf/source and accepts no inputs.
 *
 * frameImage still accepts nothing — its generator doesn't read the graph, so
 * allowing such edges would silently drop them.
